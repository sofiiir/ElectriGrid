## Mapping how distribution grid constraints shape resilient and equitable energy transition

This repository contains analysis for the MEDS 2026 Capstone ElectriGrid project. 

## Project Summary

Distributed energy resources (DER) are small-scale energy generation and storage technologies, such as rooftop solar or electric vehicles, that play a significant role in the rapid decarbonization of the energy system. The integration of DERs and the electrification of buildings and transportation are inequitably affecting communities, with the potential of wealthier communities reaping more benefits from this transition. There is currently no streamlined method for determining the inequities with consideration of both utility and socioeconomic data. Through this project, the capstone team will create a reproducible workflow that automates the linkage between the two data sources and simulates future energy scenarios. These analytical tools and data products will help utility grid planners, state energy regulators, and community advocacy groups ensure a more equitable decarbonization process.
